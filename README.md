# P9_RealEstateManager

## General informations
This repository contains an application for the P9 project of the **Grande École du Numérique** course.
RealEstateManager is a mobile application that allows real estate agents to access the files of different real estate from their mobile device.
This app works on both smartphone and tablet. To have access to the list of assets even if the agent is offline,
all data will be stored in the application database. To save the data I used the SQLite relational database engine which stores the data in a file.
The chosen orm is Android's ROOM which facilitates data manipulation.
